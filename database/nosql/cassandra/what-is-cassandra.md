# What is Cassandra

## Why FaceBook chose to develop the cassandra

Facebook has some challenges storing large-scale data, so they designed the cassandra to solve these prolems

* **High throughput:** FaceBook has billions of activate users and it will generate a large amount of data every day, including videos, posts, photos, ect. uploaded by users, Therefore, storage systems need to be able to handle high-throughput data write and read requests.
* **Data Distribution:** The traditional database always face performance bootlenecks when facing large-scale data, because they are usually single-point storage and cannot cope with the reading and writing pressure of large-scale data. Facebook needed a distributed storage system that could scale horizontally to handle massive amounts of data.
* **High availability**: FaceBook is a global online social platform with worldwide users, therefore, the storage system needs to ensure the high availablity of data, so that user always can access the data even in the event of node failure or network partition.
* **Fast Data access**: FaceBook users want they can quickly access their data, like profile, messages, photos and more, so the storage system needs to provide fast data reading and query functions to satify the needs of users
* **Fexible Data module**: The data generated by users on FaceBook is diverse and complex, eg. including structured data(such as user information), semi-structured data(such as posts and comments), and unstructured data(such as photos and videos), so the storage system needs to provide a flexible data model that can store and process different types of data.

So they developed the new storage system —— Cassandra
